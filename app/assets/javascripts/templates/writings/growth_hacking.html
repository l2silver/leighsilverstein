	Growth hacking is the marketing equivalent of the Social Network. Its jacket is sown from the brightest algorithms on this side of Boston, but it’s skin is made of potato peels.

	If you have ever read a Seth Godin, you know that stories are how people convince themselves of everything they believe. A car manufactured in Japan is better than an American car - because it is made using robotics instead of people. The yankees will win more pennant in the next 30 years than any other team - because they have the most money to spend on players. Facebook became one of the dominant web applications of the twenty-first century - because it was created by very intelligent Harvard students.

	The problem with the facebook story is that Sorkin is a bit of a romantic on the subject, and when it comes to successful people, they are always successful because they are brilliant. You see, you cannot have one with the other. Lt. Kaffey was from Harvard, President Bartlet was  a nobel laureate, Billy Bean was… some kind of cowboy, but Jonah Hill was from Harvard, and Will McAvoy once told a judge he was reasonably convinced that the defendant he was prosecuting was innocent, and therefore the case should be dismissed, which I am assuming only someone really smart would say. Also all of his characters speak faster than I can type, using words that - I can only guess are made up?

	The problem is, brilliance != success (! is computer code for not). We like to think it does, because we use stories to believe things, and brilliance is a simple story, but the truth is there were lots of reasons Facebook succeeded. Mark Zuttersomething was probably a smart guy, but instead of studying quantum physics, or solving any of the unsolved mathematical proofs in the world, he built a web application, which requires some of the most basic forms of programming in existence. He was the right guy at the right moment. I am sure his intelligence helped, but I think it was more of a barrier remover than the actual driving force behind his success.

	Growth hacking has a similar story. It is what engineers use to market their products, so you know it’s good. The problem with growth hacking is that it’s really two things, neither of which are very innovative. The first is the idea of analyzing user experience data to guide product development. That  is just good product development, it is not something new that software engineers figured out. If you are a product developer reading about this for the first time, I highly recommend delving deeper into the subject.

	Then there’s that awful part of growth marketing. Email this link to your friends to get an extra 100 megabytes of space! 4 more lives! 50 more minutes! Like all guerilla marketing tactics, this probably worked well the first time people saw it, but now it‘s old. Never in my life have I shared a link to get rewards at a website, and the same goes for all my friends and acquaintances who are younger than 45 and speak english as a first language. (I am not trying to be a racist or agist, I just think that people who grew up in different technical environments are less likely to react the same way.)

	So if growth hacking is irrelevant, then what is the alternative? There are none. Or there are lots depending on your perspective. There is no one free marketing technique that can be relied on to build an audience for a product, but there are lots of creative approaches that will get the job done. It just takes some genuine innovation, and a lot of luck.
