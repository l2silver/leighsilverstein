<p>Have you ever needed to create a controller for an MVC? How did you do it, copy and paste? Command line? Sublime plugin? Yo? (The generator).</p>
<p>Whichever way you chose, you were probably using a type of static generator.</p>
<p>You won’t be doing that anymore.</p>
<p>The problem with static generators, especially with node development, is that nothing sits still long enough to make a static generator for. Application development changes so quickly that the generators becomes obselete before they break-even on the time investment of learning or building them. It might not even be big application changes. It could be little tweaks here and there that need to be included with every new controller. You can go in and modify the source code of a generator if you have access to it to keep it up to date, but that’s a static generator problem.</p>
<p>You need a living generator.</p>
<p>Pagitter is a so-called living generator, and it works like so: You change your controller, and the generator automatically picks up the changes, and uses them with the next generation call. Better yet, you can even code inside a generator, where you have access to all of the relevant files for that generator, and where you can immediately enact changes to update the relevant files in the application.</p>
<p>Pagitter is definitely in early beta right now, but it’s at a point where it is production ready. I’m putting it to the public a little earlier than I would like because I want to hear other opinions and ideas before pagitter becomes too settled.</p>
